## My process

Hello this is my eight frontend mentor challenge and this challenge was simple but I did get confused a bit since im trying to pixel perfect it but the layout seems , well, enough of that. I'm just glad that I did it^^

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- FlexBox
- Sass preprocessor

I said that I won't use any frameworks and build it from scratch to be more exciting and challenging

### What I learned

This challenge made me more proud of what I can create using just css to style without having to use any other components^

### Continued development

I want to focus more on creating more complex designs and also designing things on my own time
